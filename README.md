# Facial-Detection-based-Attendance-Management-System
# In an era of global digitization and cybercrime, wherein every organization is prone to security breaches, it has become imperative to design an intelligent biometric system which will ensure the security of an organization. In this project, we aim to devise an intelligent system, which utilizes facial recognition to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users. The system is designed in a manner so as to imitate the human ability of recognizing faces once seen previously (in this case from a training dataset), by capturing various distinguished facial features, using a technique known as feature extraction. Since, both physiologically and anatomically, the human face is that characteristic of a person which, to a large extent, distinguishes him/her from other individuals, this parameter has been chosen as the prime yardstick for devising the intelligent system. With respect to consistency and accuracy levels, the biometric parameter of facial recognition has been chosen so that the system can deliver highly accurate and consistent results with the motive that, if this system is implemented commercially, unwanted security breaches can be prevented to a large extent.
